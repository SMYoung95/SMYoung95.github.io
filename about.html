          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>A dedicated and hard-working jack-of-many-trades with a fiery passion for game design. 
          With a Master's in Medialogy and a specialisation in Game Design, I have a great interest and focus on mechanics, balancing, and game-feel.</p>
          <p>With a vast understanding of multiple different aspects of game design, I function well as a bridge between departments. From my experiences, I am great at getting a comprehensive overview of the entire game vision allowing my design process to identify how departments are impacted by changes to new or current features. An open and outgoing colleague, putting value in a friendly and positive work environment, and always prepared to spar and provide constructive feedback based on my experience playing a variety of different types of games.</p>
          <p>Enjoying taking on the initiative in multiple areas of the entire design process and am always ready to discuss and consider new and creative design solutions.
          My approach to design is always focused with the player in mind, towards having a fun and engaging experience, while still being result and detail-oriented towards the design direction. Always eager to further my skills, I am motivated to take on new challenges and roles.</p>
          <p><strong>My areas of special Interest.</strong> There can be no doubt, that quality Game Design necessitates multi-disciplinary team work to harvest the knowledge, experience, creativity, enthusiasm and energy from a diverse team of experts in their own field of expertise. A well-functioning team promulgates synergy, experience, respect, personal development and the ability to absorb objective criticism and feedback.</p>
          <p>For these reasons I decided to study for my Masters in  Medialogy at a department of Aalborg University located in Copenhagen. This degree incorporates a diverse and varied spectrum of subjects, enabling me to gain a meta-understanding of many of areas which I believe to be integral for game design.
          The Unity game engine has been the main tool of implementation in a number of my group semester projects throughout my semesters at AAU. I have participated in two Ludum Dare game jams on my own volition together with some friends. For these I have been a part of designing the story, style, models, art, programming, level design and game-play

    <p>In parallel to my studies, I have worked as a Teachers Assistant at the university from fall 2019, covering topics such as basic 3D modelling and rendering techniques, in addition to the fundamental of programming in JavaScript. I was rehired the following year for the same two courses. The work taught me how to communicate as well as teach newcomers the fundamentals of programming and 3D modelling.</p>
    <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained experience in 3D modelling in Autodesk Maya, Animation, Sound Synthesis, User Experience Testing, Quality Assurance, Project Work, Game Design Theory, Shader Design, Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement learning in Unity, and programming in a multitude of languages.</p>
