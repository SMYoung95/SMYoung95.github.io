I am passionate about creating engaging gameplay experiences, especially in the RPG genre, and I focus on mechanics, balancing, and game feel. I have a proven track record of taking initiative and pushing myself to learn new things and take on new challenges. I believe in collaborative discourse and teamwork to make the best games possible, and I am always eager to contribute to a project in any way I can. If you're looking for a passionate and dedicated game designer with a broad skill set, I would be honored to discuss a potential project with you.</p>
