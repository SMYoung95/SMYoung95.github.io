    <p>In parallel to my studies, I have worked as a Teachers Assistant at the university from fall 2019, covering topics such as basic 3D modelling and rendering techniques, in addition to the fundamental of programming in JavaScript. I was rehired the following year for the same two courses. The work taught me how to communicate as well as teach newcomers the fundamentals of programming and 3D modelling.</p>
    <p>Throughout my studies, I have gained experience in 3D modelling in Autodesk Maya, Animation, Sound Synthesis, User Experience Testing, Quality Assurance, Project Work, Game Design Theory, Shader Design, Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement learning in Unity, and programming in a multitude of languages.</p>
